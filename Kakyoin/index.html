	<p class="p1"> What is a stand? A supernatural personification of a person's fighting spirit.<br> A person with a stand is known as a 'user'. The stands abilities are often related to their users personality, history, or living habits in some way.<br>
	Very, very rarely, someone may be born with one, but stand users are made more often than not. A handful of mysterious enchanted arrows can bring out someone's stand potential if they are injured with one, but not before causing a life threatening illness and fever. However, if that person is weak-willed or simply has no potential, they will die instead. </p>
		<p class="p1">
		<br>
		In Kakyoin's case, he is a born stand user, benefitting from a life-time of practice with his stand, Heirophant Green. His stand is long-ranged, so its not suited for face-to-face combat. This could be related to his cautious personality type.
		<br>
		<aside class="p1">(note - a stands power is directly tied to their range: the more powerful the stand, the shorter their range will be)</aside>
