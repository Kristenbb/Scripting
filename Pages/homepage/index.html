				Welcome to Medicine Hat, The Gas City! Centered in the prairies of southeastern Alberta and nestled on the banks of the South Saskatchewan River, Medicine Hat is a place filled with history. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling" target="_blank">Rudyard Kipling,</a> author of The Jungle Book, once famously described the community as <b>“having all Hell for a basement”,</b> and actively discouraged efforts to rename the city something more ‘conventional’ shortly after the discovery of natural gas deposits in 1910. (The two names being considered were ‘Gasburg’ or ‘Smithsville’.) He wrote a letter to the editor for the local newspaper, which ended up getting published to the front page. Its introduction read…
					<br>
					<br>
				<blockquote class="quote">“…To my mind, the name of Medicine Hat has an advantage over (other cities with similarly unique names). It echoes as you so justly put it the old Cree and Blackfoot tradition of red mystery and romance that once filled the prairie…”</blockquote>
					<br>
				Thanks to Rudyard Kipling, and several locals who shared his perspective, the original name was kept, and with it, the unique background and folklore of Medicine Hat was preserved. 
				There are several different versions of the legend on how Medicine Hat got its name, but the basic thread that almost all of them have involves a Blackfoot or Cree medicine man losing his hat in the river. Officially, the name comes from the native word <i>‘Saamis’,</i> which means medicine man’s hat. 
				As one can guess from this long record of legends, the land of Medicine Hat has a long history in indigenous culture, as the coulee’s that have shaped the city have been used by native peoples as shelter for centuries.
