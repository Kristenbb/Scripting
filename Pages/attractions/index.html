				<p class="Heebo">
				The Medalta district is a huge attraction in Medicine Hat. It was designated a National Historic Side in 1985, a few years before the china factory branch shut down. 
				 It was converted into an industrial museum and serves as a community hub where many different events are held, such as musician shows, local craft/artisan sales, art exhibits, and much more. Ceramics are still made there, in old-fashioned and contemporary ways, to keep the traditions alive. Tours of the factory are also held frequently at Medalta.

					<br>
				If pottery isn’t your thing, there are plenty of other activities to keep you busy.

				<p class="Heebo">The Saamis Teepee, also known as The World’s Tallest Teepee, or simply “The Teepee”, is indeed, a statue of a Teepee that is twenty stories tall. Each pole shows a huge storyboard depicting pieces of native history and culture. Constructed for the Calgary Winter Olympics in 1988, the Saamis Teepee overlooks Seven Persons Coulee and the Saamis Archaeological Site located in said coulee. The Saamis Archaeological Site is a provincial historic site where first nations people clustered in big camps to take advantage of the naturally occurring shelter from the elements, as well as using the space to process bison meat and gather water.

				<p class="Heebo">During the summer, The Windmill, a local garden store on first street, opens <a href="http://www.windmill-gardencentre.com/butterfly.htm" target="_blank">John’s Butterfly House,</a> an enclosed garden where visitors can see exotic butterfly's, adorable button quails, and tropical plants. The Butterfly House is available for private group tours, school trips, and even as a wedding venue! They also have a petting zoo featuring many birds - chickens, ducks, and parrots. If all the excitement and petting drums up your appetite, they also offer ice cream and specialty drinks at their espresso bar.

				<p class="Heebo">Also in the summer months, Medicine Hat hosts <a href="https://www.mhstampede.com/the-stampede/" target="_blank">The Exhibition and Stampede,</a> the city’s unique twist on their bigger, more widely known cousin in Calgary. A parade is held to kick off the weeks festivities, which include a midway, pioneer village, concerts from local and out-of-town musicians, dog shows, raffles, local markets, and more to be found during the festivities. In more recent years, the Stampede has begun hosting a beer garden for food and drink aficioandos. One of the most unique parts of the Medicine Hat Stampede is the Country in the City section, where farmers bring in their animals for people to view and pet. They also perform demonstrations on cow milking and sheep shearing.

			<p class="Heebo">Beyond the city limits, there are also many natural places of interest, all within an hours drive of Medicine Hat. 
			43 kilometers southwest of the city, there's Red Rock Coulee, a valley with bizarre and fascinating red-orange rock features. The coulee is home to <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/227304-Paruroctonus-boreus" target="_blank">scorpions,</a> <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/greater-short-horned-lizard" target="_blank">lizards,</a> (both of which are rare in Alberta) pronghorn antelope, jackrabbits, and rattlesnakes, so there's plenty of wildlife viewing oppurtunities, especially for those with a soft spot for reptiles and arachnids.</p>

			<p class="Heebo">66 kilometers southeast of the Hat stands Cypress Hills, an inter-provincial park between Alberta and Saskatchewan that serves as a literal island of coniferous forest in a sea of prairie. Through <a href="https://www.albertaparks.ca/parks/south/cypress-hills-pp/information-facilities/nature-history/geology/" target="_blank">complex geographical processes,</a> the land remained at a sufficent elevation for the air to be cooler and more mild than the surronding grassland, which coniferous trees prefer over the warmer, more extreme patterns common to the prairies. </p>
