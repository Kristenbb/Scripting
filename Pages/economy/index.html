				Considering its nickname of “The Gas City”, and the aforementioned famous description from Rudyard Kipling, Medicine Hat indeed has large amounts of natural gas deposits. In fact, the city has one of the largest gas fields in North America!
					<br>
				Historically, these gas deposits have been used as a cheap source of energy by the city almost since their discovery, fuelling many different industries such as wool and flour mills, greenhouses, foundries, breweries, and glass and brick manufacturers, which in turn, attracted many settlers and workers looking for new opportunities.
					<br>
				Of all the industries that the gas supported, none were as historically important as clay, which persists even into today. Medicine Hat also has an abundant supply of local clay, and in the early 1900’s, when the city was still experiencing its first population boom, this was very advantageous for the town, and clay construction materials were in high demand as more and more people were moving west.

				What clay is most associated with in Medicine Hat though, is the Medalta District. For hundreds of years, artisans have made jugs, pots, and other clay products from local materials, which are highly prized throughout Canada and America for their quality and craftsmanship. More information will be covered about Medalta in the <a href="../attractions/index.html">Attractions</a> section.</p>

				Today, gas production is still a majour player in the local economy, but in recent years, cannabis has quickly grown (no pun intended) into a big contender, as several greenhouses made room for it immediately after weed was legalized in 2018. A lot of cannabis shops opened alongside them, and the industry is thriving so far. Alongside this black sheep of a crop, <a href="https://www.bigmarble.ca/" target="_blank">many local greenhouses</a> have found success growing tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and more for the vegetable and fruit starved people of Alberta, which they are doubly so during the winter.</p>
