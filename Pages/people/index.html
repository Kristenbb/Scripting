				Medicine Hat is a well known retirement city, and for good reason. Throughout all the major cities in Canada, <a href="https://medicinehatnews.com/news/local-news/2022/04/28/hats-population-getting-older-faster/" target="_blank">Medicine Hat has the largest population of old people to young people.</a> The average age of the population is exactly 41. You would be hard pressed to find a major street without a retirement villa here. Thatâ€™s not to say that it is exclusively a retirement city, however; there are also plenty of families as well. 
					<br>
				The overall population of the city is just over sixty thousand, striking a good balance between hustle and bustle and small-town vibes. 
				Truthfully speaking, Medicine Hat is not a very diverse place. The overwhelming majority of the population speaks English and only English, while the second most spoken language, only numbering just over a thousand, is German. There are a few French immersion schools in the city, but even then, the amount of people that speak French first is only six hundred. Considering that most of the populations ethnic origin is German, and the second highest being Canada and England, it is not surprising that there is a considerable chunk of German speaking people, and English is the majority for native languages. Reflecting on this information, the visible minority in Medicine Hat is just barely seven percent. <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=POPC&Code1=0523&Geo2=PR&Code2=47&Data=Count&SearchText=Medicine%20Hat&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All" target="_blank">(All of this data from Statistics Canada, Census Profile 2016)</a> There is no widespread mistrust or hatred toward said minorities, but it is a fact worth noting for those who are used to seeing higher diversity in major population centres.
