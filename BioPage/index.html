			<p>When it comes to nature, I am a self-taught expert. From the tiniest mammal to the most gargantuan gas giants, it all fascinates me deeply. As such, I enjoy photographing nature, capturing the minute beauty of flowers, the cuteness of animals, or the grandeur of mountains. It is my hope that through my work, I can get others to appreciate the natural world around us a little bit more. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Just for fun, I sometimes pretend I am in a real life game of <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Snap" target="_blank">Pokemon Snap</a> and try to expand my album with at least 3 pictures of animals I haven’t gotten yet. Bonus points if I can capture moments of their every day lives or unusual behaviour. One example of this that I am particularly proud of, even though I couldn’t get close enough for the photo to be featured in National Geographic or anything, is of two pelicans and a seagull fighting over a dead fish at the park.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">I also enjoy sketching and painting. As you probably have guessed by now, a large chunk of my work features animals and landscapes. In the case of the former, I am especially skilled at drawing cats because of two reasons; 1. Cats (the domestic species, <i>Felis Catus</i>, and the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_cat" target="_blank">wild ones,</a> too) are my all time favourite animals, and 2. I have practiced drawing them for many years, due to my aforementioned obsession. 

		Over the years though, I decided to expand my horizons and have begun practicing drawing in different styles, portraits, and people in general. I have improved considerably, but there is still much to learn!(I don't have a lot of my drawings scanned to my computer, so this is a very old piece I did, related to a <a class ="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_(novel_series)" target="_blank">book series</a> I read when I was younger.</p>

				<p>What I love the most however, is writing. Aside from the obvious basics, (learning to read, write and the rules of grammar in school) I am entirely self taught. I first picked up an interest in storytelling when I was five, penning tales about the misadventures of my favourite toys. My teachers took it upon themselves to nurture my tiny sliver of talent, setting aside class time every month for me to share stories I would write about my classmates. The feedback I received from these sessions was invaluable, and the memory of them has been an endless source of encouragement during those inevitable bouts of writer-specific self doubt. I have been writing stories and poetry ever since.</p>
